This is the project I have made by myself! Have taken help from internet sources for syntax checking. 

### To run the frontend, navigate to the to-do-list folder and write 'npm start'. Frontend will open on port 3000

### To run the backend, navigate to the backend folder (cd backend) and write 'node server.js'. Backend will be connected successfully and message for the same will appear in the terminal.

I am facing some issues regarding database connectivity for now, but I'll fix it in upcoming 2-3 days. Uploading my work till date then, because of constraints of submitting the project by today only.

Thank you :)
